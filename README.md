_My Portfolio Revamped_

## Overview
Welcome to my portfolio. The advent of Web Development has changed the landscape of communication and interaction in our society. We now live in a digital world and gone are the days of sending physical postcards, letters, and applications. In keeping with that trend, herein is an attempt to digitize my CV in the form of a simple web page.

## Purpose
This revamped wersion of my web page is designed to provide an easy but effective way to access my CV. Its simplicity and dynamism gives it an irresistible appeal to like-minded Web Developers wanting to showcase themselves.  I hope that this digital representation of my profile, skills, qualifications, and experience meets your satisfaction as you peruse through its contents. Although it is just a mere tip of the iceberg, I am quietly confident that it will go some way to convince you of the depth of talent, creativity, passion, and hard work which are my core strengths.
